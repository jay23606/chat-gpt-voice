# github-explorer

Really simply github file explorer and file editor using a text input field and an "up" button to navigate directories and a textarea to make changes.

To add files just type the name of the file you want in the text input element and you can also create directories this way.

Requires github API token with repo access to be entered which is stored in localStorage.
