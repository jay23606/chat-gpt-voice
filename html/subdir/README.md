# github-explorer

Github file explorer and editor built with plain client-side JS. It lets you navigate directories, make edits, add files/folders, and upload multiple files using a text input field and textarea. You need a github API token with repo access which gets stored in localStorage. Additionally, you can pass the `owner` in the querystring. The globe icon opens the file in a new tab using githack.

Uses GitHub REST and GraphQL endpoints:
